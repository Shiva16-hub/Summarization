
**Overview**
This project includes a backend developed in Python using Flask (or FastAPI) and a frontend developed in React. The backend handles file uploads and text summarization, while the frontend allows users to interact with the backend.

**Prerequisites**
Python: Download and install from python.org.
Node.js: Download and install from nodejs.org.

**Backend Setup**
Set Up the Backend Environment:
cd backend

Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:
venv\Scripts\activate

**Install Backend Dependencies**
Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Configure the Backend**
Create the Main Application File: -- App.py for Flask
For FastAPI, the structure will be different. main.py:

**Run the Backend**
Start the FastAPI Server:
uvicorn main:app --reload

**Frontend Setup**
Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
cd frontend

Install Frontend Dependencies:
npm install

Configure the Frontend:
Create App.js

Run the Frontend:
npm start
The frontend will be running at http://localhost:3000.

**Connecting Frontend and Backend**
Ensure Both Services Are Running:

Start the backend service (FastAPI).
Start the frontend service (React).
Configure CORS:
Ensure that your backend is configured to handle CORS requests (e.g., using Flask-Cors for Flask or FastAPI's CORS settings).

Verify Functionality:

Open your React app in a browser and test the file upload functionality. Ensure it communicates properly with the backend and handles responses.

**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues, ensure that the backend and frontend are running on different ports and that the URLs in your frontend code match the backend endpoints.
